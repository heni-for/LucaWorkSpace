## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#64B5F6), suggesting productivity and calm. It offers enough contrast with the light and dark backgrounds.
- Background color (light theme): Light gray (#F5F5F5), for a clean, modern look.
- Background color (dark theme): Dark blue-gray (#37474F), to provide a professional, focused experience.
- Accent color: Lavender (#D1C4E9), adding a touch of sophistication and to differentiate actionable elements from surrounding information.
- Body: 'Inter' (sans-serif), for a neutral, readable, and modern appearance, especially suited for blocks of text.
- Headlines: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif), for headlines, giving a futuristic yet readable font with character.
- Use consistent, minimalist icons from a library like Feather or Remix Icons.
- Maintain a clean, organized layout with clear visual hierarchy.
- Incorporate subtle animations for feedback and transitions. For example, when a task is marked complete or an email is archived.
